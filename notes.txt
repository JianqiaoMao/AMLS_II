- must use python==3.6
- had to separately python -m pip install numpy=1.16.0 so could install scikit-image when install reqs.txt file
- had to free up swap memory on machine so packages could be installed https://askubuntu.com/questions/178712/how-to-increase-swap-space
- need to do apt-get install python3.6-dev in order to install dlib. Also had to install cmake. And to get cmake to work, had to do sudo apt-get install g++ to enable cmake to access compiler. After all this can run python -m pip install dlib==19.16.0
- after above, can run python -m pip install -r requirements.txt. If using conda, add env to selectable kernels with python -m ipykernel install --user --name <env_name> --display-name "<env_display_name>"
